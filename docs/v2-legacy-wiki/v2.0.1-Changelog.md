## v2.0.1 Changelog

### Provider Changes
* Grapheme positioning and clustering probabilities are now set by calling `WithProbability()` on a `SyllableProvider`
```C#
var g = new NameGenerator()
            .UsingProvider(x => x
                .WithVowels("ae")
                .WithLeadingConsonants("str")
                .WithTrailingConsonants("mnl")
                .WithProbability(x => x
                    .LeadingConsonantExists(1.0)
                    .TrailingConsonantExists(0.20)));
```

* Weights can now be assigned directly to consonants and vowels to influence their frequency of use

```C#
var g = new NameGenerator()
    .UsingProvider(x => x
        .WithVowels("a").Weight(5) // This vowel will now occur 2.5 times more often than other vowels
        .WithVowels("ei").Weight(2)
        .WithConsonants("trs"));
```

### Mutator (Transformer) Changes

* Name mutators have been reimplemented and are now called name `Transformers`. Similarly, Mutations are now `Transforms` and MutationSteps are `TransformSteps`.
* Transformation frequency is now set by calling `Select()` and `Chance()` directly on a `Transformer`
* Weights can now be assigned to transforms to influence their frequency
```C#
var g = new NameGenerator()
        .UsingProvider(x => x
            .WithVowels("ae")
            .WithLeadingConsonants("str"))
        .UsingTransformer(x => x
            .Select(1).Chance(0.5)
            .WithTransform(x => x.AppendSyllable("gard")).Weight(2)
            .WithTransform(x => x.AppendSyllable("dar")))
        .UsingSyllableCount(3);
```

*  Additionally, all `Transforms` are now serializable unless using `ExecuteUnserializableAction()` 

### Validator (Filter) Changes
* Name validators are now name `Filters`
* `DoNotAllow()`, `DoNotAllowEnding()`, `DoNotAlllowBeginning()` methods have been added to filters as an alternative to providing regular expressions
```C#
var g = new NameGenerator()
            .UsingFilter(x => x
                .DoNotAllowEnding("j","p","q","w")             // Invalidate these awkward endings
                .DoNotAllowPattern(@"(\w)\1\1")                // Invalidate any sequence of 3 or more identical letters
                .DoNotAllowPattern(@"([^aeiouAEIOU])\1\1\1")); // Invalidate any sequence of 4 or more consonants
```

### Serialization Changes
* `ConfigurationFile` has been replaced with class `NameGeneratorSerializer`

### Minor changes
* `NameGenerator` `LimitSyllableCount()` is now `UsingSyllableCount()`
* Added `SyllableSet` as first alternative to `SyllableProvider`
* Syllabore now uses [Archigen](https://github.com/kesac/Archigen)
